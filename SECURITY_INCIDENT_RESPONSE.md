## Response Procedures

### 1. Detection & Initial Assessment (0-15 minutes)

```bash
# Check active security alerts
curl https://your-bot.com/api/security/alerts

# Review recent audit logs
SELECT * FROM audit_logs 
WHERE severity IN ('critical', 'error') 
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

# Check system health
npm run db:monitor
```

**Actions:**
1. Verify the incident is real (not false positive)
2. Determine severity level
3. Notify incident commander
4. Start incident log/timeline
5. Preserve initial evidence

### 2. Containment (15-60 minutes)

#### Immediate Containment
```bash
# Block suspicious IPs
redis-cli SADD security:ip:blacklist "suspicious-ip"

# Disable compromised accounts
UPDATE users SET disabled = true WHERE slack_user_id = 'compromised-user';

# Increase rate limits
redis-cli SET rl:msg:global:limit 5

# Enable emergency mode (if implemented)
redis-cli SET system:emergency_mode true
```

#### Short-term Containment
- Isolate affected systems
- Disable compromised features
- Implement additional monitoring
- Backup current state

### 3. Investigation (Ongoing)

#### Data Collection
```sql
-- Export audit logs for investigation
COPY (
  SELECT * FROM audit_logs 
  WHERE created_at BETWEEN 'start-time' AND 'end-time'
) TO '/tmp/incident-audit-logs.csv' CSV HEADER;

-- Check for data exfiltration
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as access_count
FROM audit_logs
WHERE event_type = 'data.export'
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
```

#### Analysis Tools
- Log analysis scripts
- Database query tools
- Network traffic analysis
- Memory dump analysis

### 4. Eradication

#### Remove Threat
```bash
# Revoke all sessions
redis-cli --scan --pattern "session:*" | xargs redis-cli DEL

# Rotate credentials
export NEW_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="xoxb-new-token"
export NEW_OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-new-key"

# Update and restart services
npm run build
pm2 restart all
```

#### Verify Removal
- Scan for backdoors
- Check for persistence mechanisms
- Validate system integrity
- Review access logs

### 5. Recovery

#### Service Restoration
```bash
# Restore from clean backup if needed
pg_restore -d pup_ai_v2 backup.dump

# Re-enable features gradually
redis-cli DEL system:emergency_mode

# Monitor for issues
npm run db:monitor
tail -f logs/app.log | grep ERROR
```

#### Validation
- Test all functionality
- Verify data integrity
- Check performance metrics
- Confirm security controls
