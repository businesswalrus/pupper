# Security Documentation - pup.ai v2

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in pup.ai v2, including data protection, compliance features, and security best practices.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Zero-Trust Security Model
- All requests are authenticated and authorized
- Principle of least privilege for all operations
- Continuous verification throughout the session

### 2. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Redundant security measures
- Fail-secure defaults

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

#### Slack Authentication
- Signature verification for all Slack requests using HMAC-SHA256
- Timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks
- Request nonce tracking for duplicate prevention

#### Session Management
- Redis-backed secure sessions
- Session tokens generated using cryptographically secure random bytes
- 24-hour session timeout with automatic cleanup
- HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies

#### Permission System
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Fine-grained permissions for operations:
  - `message.read` - Read message content
  - `message.write` - Send messages
  - `search.execute` - Perform searches
  - `data.export` - Export user data
  - `data.delete` - Delete user data
  - `admin.access` - Administrative functions

### Data Protection

#### Encryption at Rest
- AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive fields
- Field-level encryption for PII data
- Secure key derivation using scrypt
- Automatic encryption/decryption in database layer

#### Encryption in Transit
- TLS 1.3 for all external communications
- HSTS with preload for HTTPS enforcement
- Certificate pinning for critical APIs

#### Data Sanitization
- Input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
- XSS prevention through HTML entity encoding
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries
- Prompt injection detection for AI interactions

### Rate Limiting

Implemented sliding window rate limits:
- Messages: 30/minute per user
- AI Responses: 5/minute per user
- Search: 10/5 minutes per user
- Embeddings: 100/hour per user
- API calls: 100/minute per IP

### Security Headers

Comprehensive security headers:
```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
Content-Security-Policy: [restrictive policy]
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: [restrictive permissions]
```

### CSRF Protection
- Double-submit cookie pattern
- Custom header verification
- Token rotation on authentication
- SameSite cookie attribute

### Request Signing
- HMAC-SHA256 signatures for webhooks
- Timestamp and nonce validation
- Replay attack prevention
- Automatic signature verification middleware

## Compliance Features

### GDPR Compliance

#### Data Subject Rights
1. **Right to Access**: `/api/gdpr/export/:userId`
   - Complete data export in JSON format
   - Includes all messages, interactions, and profiles
   - 30-day download link expiration

2. **Right to Erasure**: `/api/gdpr/delete/:userId`
   - Configurable deletion scope (all/messages/profile)
   - 30-day grace period before deletion
   - Audit trail of deletion requests

3. **Right to Data Portability**: Structured data export
4. **Right to Rectification**: API endpoints for data updates

#### Consent Management
- Granular consent tracking:
  - Data processing
  - Analytics
  - Marketing communications
- Consent audit trail with timestamps
- Easy consent withdrawal

#### Data Retention
- Automated data retention policies:
  - Messages: 180 days
  - Summaries: 365 days
  - Interactions: 90 days
  - Audit logs: 730 days (2 years)
  - Compliance logs: 2555 days (7 years)

### SOC2 Controls
